UP School Capstone Project/ Getir Case


The aim of this study is to examine how crimes have changed over the years, whether it is possible to predict where and when a crime will be committed, and the distribution of crimes across the city. Crimes in Boston data were used in the study. Data contains information about the crime such as date, location, crime group, crime code.

The first step of the study is exploratory data analysis. The second stage consists of models aiming to predict where and when the crime may occur.

This project was made in partnership with Up School. (https://www.upschool.io)
